# Let us audit your software and identify <ins>technical debt</ins>

Are you planning to invest in a new startup?
Have you got an on-going project?
No matter how much you trust the team and how motivated it is,
you may regularly [want](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html)
to review what they are doing,
in order to [prevent](https://youtu.be/GlBf5-g4nGk) problems earlier.

# Why us?

First, since all projects in Zerocracy are done by freelancers,
who can be very unpredictable, we know how to fight for quality.
Second, we've audited over 300 projects already in our
[Annual Quality Award](https://www.yegor256.com/award.html).
Third, since we are a multi-project company, we can review
your artifacts from a fresh perspective.

# Do it on a regular basis

{:.wide}
Hire [our experts](https://www.0crat.com/team) to provide you with
an <ins>independent opinion</ins> about what your team is doing.
Our reviewers will tell you what kind of technical issues
your software product has and what the <ins>risks</ins> and <ins>threats</ins>
are that you should pay attention to.

# Don't wait until programmers <ins>mess</ins> everything up

Hire our [high-caliber software engineers](https://www.0crat.com/team)
for a few hours to get your repositories audited.
This will protect your project from possible disasters.

<hr/>

{:.wide}
# We work with most tech stacks

{:.wide}
[Our experts](https://www.0crat.com/team)
understand Java, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, Python and C#.
If you use something else, we can find the right talents
to review that project too.

# We work <ins>remotely</ins> and never talk to your team

There is no need for us to communicate with your
programmers, ask any questions, or disturb them in any way.
You give us read-only access to your repository, your
logs, your database, and we review what we see, remotely.

<hr/>

{:.wide}
# We sign the NDA before we start

{:.wide}
Each reviewer will sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement with you,
confirming that all data received during the review
will be destroyed when the audit is done.

# It takes five days and costs <ins>$2,560</ins>

There are [three types](http://www.zerocracy.com/audits.html) of audits:
quick, standard, and detailed. Most probably your project
needs a standard audit, which will give you enough food for thought
and will help your team improve. You pay by PayPal, VISA/MasterCard,
or Bitcoin.
